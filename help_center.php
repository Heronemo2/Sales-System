            <div class="faq-list">
                <details open><summary>How do I create a quotation?</summary><p>Open Sales Quotation from Core Sales, review the customer information, then create or manage the quotation from that page.</p></details>
                <details><summary>What happens after a quotation is approved?</summary><p>Sales sends the requested product and quantity to Inventory. If Inventory has enough stock, the quotation becomes Approved and Sales can create a Purchase Order. The Purchase Order can then be converted into a Sales Order, followed by delivery, invoicing, and collection.</p></details>
                <details><summary>What if Inventory does not have enough stock?</summary><p>The quotation is marked Rejected/awaiting stock. Procurement and Production remain outside this Sales system. Once Inventory has stocked the finished product, Sales can use Re-check Stock on the quotation.</p></details>
                <details><summary>Why does Sales have product codes but not a product table?</summary><p>Inventory owns the product and stock data. Sales stores the product code and the Inventory product ID returned by the Inventory service as a soft reference, without creating foreign keys into Inventory's database.</p></details>
                <details><summary>What is the Purchase Order?</summary><p>In this Sales module, the Purchase Order is the Sales-side document created from an Inventory-approved quotation. It is not the Procurement department's raw-material purchasing process.</p></details>
                <details><summary>Where can I check unpaid customer balances?</summary><p>Open Billing & Financial Accounting, then choose Accounts Receivable or Customer Balance.</p></details>
                <details><summary>How can I change my password?</summary><p>Open the profile menu and select Account Settings. Enter your current password and your new password.</p></details>
